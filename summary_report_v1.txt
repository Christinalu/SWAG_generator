Usually, deep learning refers to more deep networks than the classic machine learning ones, utilizing big data. 2.3 State-of-the-art CNNs for Transfer Learning In this section, a brief description of the CNNs employed for automatic detection is illustrated. Machine learning and Deep Learning have become established disciplines in applying artificial intelligence to mine, analyze, and recognize patterns from data. In Deep Learning, this process involves the initial training of a CNN for a specific task (e.g., classification), utilizing large-scale datasets. The collected data includes 224 images with confirmed Covid-19, 700 images with confirmed common pneumonia, and 504 images of normal condition.
